This more than 10 years old Fortran-90 code is a time dependent molecular dynamics simulation of a gas of diatomic molecules (several molecular parameters, such as mass, bond length and force parameters may be chosen). 
The initial conditions that might be chosen include, but not limited to: laser pulse rotational kick, molecular centrifuge (uni-directionally rotating molecules oriented in a specific plane), rotationally hot molecules 
(Boltzmann - distributed) etc.

Several papers I know of were published with results created using this Fortran code:
